<b>pclass</b>: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)

1st = Upper

2nd = Middle

3rd = Lower

<b>age</b>: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

<b>sibsp</b>: The dataset defines family relations in this way...

Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister

Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fiancés were ignored)

<b>parch</b>: The dataset defines family relations in this way...

Parent = mother, father

Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson

Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
